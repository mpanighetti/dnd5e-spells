# Mambo Marino

_3rd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (Ritual)_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a mola scale; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

You create a glowing 10-foot-diameter circle in a body of water you can see within range. The circle lasts for the spell's duration. At any time before the spell ends, as an action, you and any willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you can attempt to teleport to the circle. If the space is occupied or cannot accommodate all the creatures you specify, the teleportation fails. Otherwise, any creatures teleported by this spell instantly appear within the circle, and the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, concentration is no longer required to maintain the spell, and for each spell level above 3rd, the diameter of the glowing circle you create increases by 10 feet and the duration is doubled. Additionally, if any circles exist from your previous castings of the spell, they continue to function and inherit the new spell duration.
