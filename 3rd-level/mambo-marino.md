_3rd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (Ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a mola scale; an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
- **Classes:** Bard

You create a glowing 10-foot-diameter circle in the surface of a body of water you can see within range. The circle lasts for the spell's duration. At any time before the spell ends, as a Magic Action, you and any willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you can attempt to teleport to the circle. If the circle is more than 1 mile away, or if the circle's space is occupied or cannot accommodate all the creatures you specify, the teleportation fails. Otherwise, any creatures teleported by this spell instantly appear within the circle, and the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, for each spell level above 3rd: the diameter of the glowing circle you create increases by 10 feet; the spell's duration increases to 1 day (5th-level), 1 week (7th-level), or 1 month (9th-level); and when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, it lasts for the full duration. Additionally, if you cast this spell again before the duration ends, any circles that existed from your previous casting of the spell continue to function and inherit the new duration, unless you are more than 1 mile away from an existing circle, in which case all such circles disappear. While multiple circles exist, you can choose any of them as a destination when teleporting using this spell.
