# Wind's Requiem

_3rd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (Ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp; a piece of cloth from a ship's sail which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Bard, Ranger (Wild Composer)

You create an unnatural strong wind at your back, overriding any existing wind direction affecting you. Until the spell ends, your jumping distance is tripled, and while you are on the deck of a sailing ship, it moves as if it is sailing with the wind. While concentrating on this spell, at the end of each of your turns, you can select a new direction for the winds around you to blow.

While concentrating on this spell, as a Magic action, you can attempt to channel this magical wind to carry yourself and jump up to your jumping distance without using any movement. Make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check and add your spellcasting ability modifier, contested by a DC equal to one-sixth the number of feet you are attempting to jump (minimum DC 10, maximum DC 25). On a success, if there is level ground with enough space to accommodate you, you land safely at your intended destination. If there is insufficient space to land safely at your intended jump distance, you fall short in a safe space of your choice. On a failure, or if there is no eligible space to land safely in your path, your jump falls short a number of feet equal to your Athletics or Acrobatics check, and you fall Prone. Whether you succeed or fail, the spell ends immediately.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your jumping distance is multiplied by the spell slot number. For example, casting this spell at 4th-level would cause your jumping distance to be quadrupled.
