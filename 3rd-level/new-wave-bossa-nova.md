# New Wave Bossa Nova

_Level 3 Abjuration/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V (functions even if you are in an area affected by magical silence), S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, you create a sphere of healing energy that negates the effects of magical silence, such as the _silence_ spell, and the effects of magical darkness, such as the _darkness_ spell. The sphere moves with you. Creatures within this sphere hear normally in magical silence and see normally in magical darkness, and can speak, hear, see, and cast spells normally. Any spells or magical effects causing silence or darkness are not dispelled, but they cannot affect any creatures within the negating sphere. If the negating sphere is contained completely within an area of magical silence or magical darkness, any such magical sound or light stops at the edge of the sphere and cannot travel in or out of it.
