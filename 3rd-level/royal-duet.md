# Royal Duet

_3rd-level evocation/rhythmancy (Duet)_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You and a partner play an empowering duet, targeting a shared location within range. When the spell finishes casting, any creatures who remained within the spells' area of effect for the entire casting and were able to hear the entire composition have advantage on a single d20 test of their choice that they make within the spells' duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you and your partner both cast this spell using spell slots of 4th-level or higher, for each spell level above 3rd, all creatures who gained advantage on a d20 test also gain a +1 to the roll. If the spells are cast at different levels, use the lower of the two levels. For example, if the spell is cast using a 5th-level and a 6th-level spell slot, creatures would gain the bonus from the 5th-level spell slot, which would be a +2 to their roll.
