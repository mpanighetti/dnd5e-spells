# Peaceful Lullaby

_3rd-level enchantment/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You play a gentle melody in an attempt to lull a creature that can hear you in range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or fall asleep and remain Unconscious until the spell ends, the target takes damage, or another creature takes an action to wake them. Constructs and undead automatically succeed on this Saving Throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, for each spell slot above 3rd, the duration increases by 1 hour, and you can target an additional creature.
