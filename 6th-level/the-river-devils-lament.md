# The River Devil's Lament

_Level 6 Enchantment/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp; water from a river that flows backward which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You recite the tale of an ancient hero who drove away a great evil, in order to instill lasting terror in a creature you can see within range that can hear you. That creature must make a Wisdom Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target is Cursed for the duration of the spell. While Cursed in this manner, the creature is Frightened of you, and if the creature can see you at the start of their turn, they take 3d10 Psychic damage. Creatures that are normally immune to being Frightened are not immune to the Frightened condition caused by this spell's curse. While the Cursed creature cannot see you, they are Frightened of your last known location.

Each time the creature takes damage (except from this spell's effects), they can repeat their Saving Throw, ending the Cursed condition on a success. You can additionally choose to end the curse by using a Magic action to dismiss the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, the duration increases to 1 day (7th-level), 30 days (8th-level), or 1 year (9th-level), and the Psychic damage dealt when the creature can see you increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 6th. Additionally, when you cast this spell at 8th-level or higher, the creature can no longer repeat their Saving Throws when they take damage.
