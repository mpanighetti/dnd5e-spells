# The River Devil's Lament

_6th-level enchantment/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; water from a river that flows backward which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You recite the tale of an ancient hero who drove away a great evil, in order to instill lasting terror in a creature you can see within range that can hear you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is cursed. While cursed in this manner, the creature is frightened of you, and if the creature can see you at the start of its turn, it takes 3d10 psychic damage. This cursed fright ignores immunity to the frightened condition, and persists even when the creature cannot see you, preventing the creature from moving toward your last known location.

Each time the creature takes damage (except from this spell's effects), it can repeat its saving throw, ending its curse on a success. You can additionally choose to end the curse by using an action to dismiss the spell. Otherwise, the creature remains cursed for the duration of the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, the duration increases to 1 day (7th-level), 30 days (8th-level), or 1 year (9th-level), and the psychic damage dealt when the creature can see you increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 6th. Additionally, when you cast this spell at 8th-level or higher, the creature can no longer repeat its saving throws when it takes damage.
