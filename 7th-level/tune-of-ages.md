# Tune of Ages

_7th-level Conjuration/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magic item or a willing creature from the destination time period; an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures within range are removed from your current time period and appear in the same physical location in another time period you choose.

The selected time period must at least specify the destination year, but can be more specific if desired. Additionally, the magic item or willing creature specified in the spell's material components must have existed in the time period you specify and must accompany you in the time travel. If any of these conditions are not met, the spell fails.
