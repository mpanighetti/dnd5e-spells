# Oath to Order

_8th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 8 hours

- **Duration:** 30 days

You call upon the spirits of ancient giants to grant you the ability to repel massive bodies. The spell can only take effect if you maintain contact with the ground the entire time you cast the spell, otherwise it fails.

Until the spell ends, as an action, you can target a creature or object within 30 feet of you and attempt to repel it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or it is forcibly shoved a distance of your choice up to 100 feet away from you in a straight line and knocked prone. If the target is a creature that is already prone, it is additionally stunned until the end of your next turn.

Manipulating gravity and mass in this manner takes a physical toll on your body. Each time you attempt to repel a creature, at the end of your turn, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw contested by your own spell save DC or suffer one level of exhaustion.
