# Ballad of Gales

_8th-level Conjuration/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp, a vehicle that you are currently occupying worth at least 10 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 round

If you occupy a vehicle the entire time you cast this spell, you summon a shimmering portal surrounding the vehicle, and a second portal of the same size at another location on the same plane of existence. If the vehicle is a ship in water, the portals manifest as powerful cyclones in the waters at both locations. The portals remain open until the end of your next turn. Any creature or object that enters one portal, including you and all other creatures and objects aboard the target vehicle, instantly appears within 5 feet of the other portal, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. After the spell ends, the portals fade away.

You must have seen or been physically present at the destination at least once before, and the destination must have sufficient space to accommodate the vehicle, or the spell fails. The spell also fails when targeting a ship in water if the destination is not also in water.

The act of teleporting the vehicle deals it 8d6 Force damage, ignoring damage thresholds.
