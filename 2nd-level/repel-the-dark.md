- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)

You summon the cleansing power of sunlight, causing creatures of the night to cower in fear. When you cast this spell, all Undead creatures and all creatures with sunlight sensitivity within range that can see you must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become Stunned for the spell's duration. At the end of each of their turns, a creature Stunned by this spell can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the condition on a success.

For the spell's duration, you shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. This light is sunlight.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, any creatures forced to make a Constitution Saving Throw by this spell make their Saving Throw with Disadvantage if their Challenge Rating is less than the spell's level.
