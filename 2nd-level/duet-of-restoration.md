# Duet of Restoration

_2nd-level evocation/rhythmancy (duet)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and a partner play an uplifting duet, targeting a shared location within range. When the spell finishes casting, any creatures that remained within the spells' area of effect for the entire casting and were able to hear the entire composition gain the benefits of a short rest. A creature must complete a long rest before it can gain this benefit from this song again.

**At Higher Levels.** When you and your partner both cast this spell using spell slots of 3rd-level or higher, all creatures that gained the benefits of a short rest from this spell also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the spells' combined levels; for example, if both spells are cast at 3rd-level, a creature gains 12 temporary hit points, or (3 + 3) Ã— 2.
