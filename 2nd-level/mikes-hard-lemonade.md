_2nd-level evocation_
 
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bottle of lemon-flavored malt beverage)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You hurl a bottle of alcoholic lemonade at a target creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are also poisoned. A creature poisoned by this spell repeats their saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on the success.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, it deals an additional 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 2nd.
