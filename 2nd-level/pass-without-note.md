# Pass without Note

_2nd-level enchantment_ (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scrap of garment common to your current setting and a dab of makeup applied to your face)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of irrelevance radiates from you, masking you and your companions from notice in social situations. To casual observers, you appear unremarkable and uninteresting compared to other people in the setting, and they have difficulty recalling anything noteworthy about your appearance or presence. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Charisma checks made to go unnoticed and can't be observed socially except by magical means, such as divination spells.

Creatures who are immune to the Charmed condition ignore the spell's bonus to Charisma checks when making contested checks to observe the spell's targets.
