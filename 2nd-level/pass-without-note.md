# Pass Without Note

_Level 2 Enchantment_ (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scrap of garment common to the current social setting and a dab of makeup applied to your face)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You radiate an aura of irrelevance in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Charisma checks made to be dismissed or go unnoticed socially, appearing unremarkable and uninteresting compared to other people in the setting. Creatures who fail checks to notice you have difficulty recalling anything noteworthy about your appearance or presence. Creatures who are immune to the Charmed condition ignore the spell's bonus to Charisma checks when making contested checks.
