# Command Melody

_2nd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (Ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; objects belonging to you and the target creature worth a total of at least 1 sp which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Bard

You conduct a brief tune for a willing creature within range that can hear you. Until the spell ends, while the target is on the same plane of existence as you, both you and the target are magically linked to each other. A creature can only be linked to one other creature at a time using this spell.

A creature can communicate with their link telepathically. Additionally, as an action, a creature can see through their link's eyes and hear what they hear until the start of the creature's next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that their link has, but they are Blinded and Deafened to their own surroundings.

If a creature casts a spell with a range of touch, their link can deliver the spell as if the link had cast the spell. The caster's link must be within 100 feet of them, and the link must choose to use their Reaction to deliver the spell when cast. If the spell requires an attack roll, the casting creature uses their attack modifier for the roll.

A linked creature can sever this magical link at any time, which ends the spell.
