You stir slumbering creatures with rousing music. When you cast this spell, choose up to three creatures within range under the effect of magical sleep that can hear you. The targets, as well as all other naturally Unconscious creatures within range that can hear you, immediately regain consciousness. Until the spell ends, magic can't put creatures within range to sleep, as long as they can still hear you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
