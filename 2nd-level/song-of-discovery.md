# Song of Discovery

_Level 2 Divination/Rhythmancy (Ritual)_ (Bard, Ranger (Wild Composer))

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (20-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp, a magnifying glass worth at least 10 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You perform a tune that disrupts any concealing magic in the vicinity. Until the spell ends, as a Magic action, you can attempt to reveal Invisible creatures and objects within your spell's area of effect. Make a spellcasting ability check. If there is a spell causing invisibility in your spell's area of effect, the DC equals 10 + the most powerful such spell's level in the area, or if the only invisibility present is caused by another magical effect, the DC is 15. On a success, all magical invisibility in the area of effect is dispelled, and this spell ends immediately. On a failure, or if there is no such magical invisibility nearby, your spell continues, but you gain no special insight into whether this outcome occurred due to failing the check or no viable Invisible creatures or objects being nearby.
