# Song of Storms

_Level 1 Evocation/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet (1 mile if cast outdoors)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pebble or stone worn smooth by water used to forecast rainy weather; an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a storm cloud that is 10 feet tall with a 20-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

Until the spell ends, light rain falls in the area underneath the cloud. Invisible creatures under the cloud have disadvantage on attempts to hide as the rain patters on their bodies and reveals their locations as an outline of raindrops. The cloud moves with you.

If you are outdoors in a light rain when you cast this spell, the spell affects the existing storm instead of creating a new cloud. Under such conditions, the storm becomes a heavy rain, causing the area to be lightly obscured, extinguishing open flames, and imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.
