# Equine Tribute

_1st-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of horse grass; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Bard

You recant the tale of a great hero's beloved horse companion to endear yourself to a horse with an Intelligence score less than 10 within range; at the Game Master's discretion, you can target a creature other than a horse, as long as they are at least one size category larger than you and have an appropriate anatomy to serve as your mount. If the target is willing, is able to hear you, and remains within range for the entire casting of the spell, they are considered to be your companion.

A companion is your ally. In combat, they share your initiative count, and they function as a controlled mount (as defined in the rules on mounted combat). If you are Incapacitated, your companion takes their turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you. A creature can only be a companion to one other creature at a time.

When you cast this spell and already have a companion, instead of making a new companion, you can either teleport your companion to a location within range (or the nearest unoccupied space that can accommodate your companion), or send your companion within range to the last location you summoned them from.

If your companion is mistreated or harmed by you or any of your allies, or at their own discretion, they can choose to end their companionship to you, and you can similarly end this companionship at any time. If you already have a companion and target a new creature with this spell, the previous companionship ends. Otherwise, the companionship lasts until you or your companion dies.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell to summon your companion using a Spell Slot of 2nd-level or higher, they gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to five times the Spell Slot level.
