A Medium-sized inanimate scarecrow appears anchored to the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The destination must have at least enough space to accommodate the scarecrow, or the spell fails.

The scarecrow can act as a target for a thrown grappling hook or similar equipment, and it can support up to 500 pounds of weight. It disappears when you cast this spell again.
