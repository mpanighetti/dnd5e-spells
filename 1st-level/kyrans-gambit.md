# Kyran's Gambit

_Level 1 Abjuration_ (Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Warlock)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of the target's blood, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to drag a creature you touch to another plane of existence to confront them alone. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails. The spell also fails if you or the target are prevented from planeshifting.

On a failed save, both you and the target are banished to a demiplane for the duration. The demiplane takes on a disturbing appearance of your choice each time you enter it. Damage dealt to a creature in this demiplane that would reduce them to 0 Hit Points instead reduces them to 1 Hit Point. A creature that starts their turn in the demiplane is wracked with pain and mental torment, taking 2d8 Psychic damage. If you are the caster of this spell and take this Psychic damage, the damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and it doesn't break your Concentration to maintain this spell. Once the spell ends, all creatures in the demiplane are returned to their original locations. Removing you or the target from the demiplane also ends the spell.

After the spell ends, or if the spell fails, the target is immune to this spell for the next 24 hours.

_**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.**_ The damage dealt by starting a turn in the demiplane increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1. Additionally, if you use a level 6+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration. This spell can be cast in place of a Mystic Arcanum spell you know as if it were cast using a spell slot of that spell's level, expending the use of that spell.
