# The Lost is Found

_1st-level divination/rhythmancy (Ritual)_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a branch or leaf from a tree you've climbed; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You play a song to yourself that stirs old memories of a childhood friend. Until the spell ends, while you are traveling or exploring within the same environment you were in when casting the spell, you can't become lost except by magical means.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the duration increases to a number of hours equal to the spell slot level. Additionally, until the spell ends, if magical effects cause you to become lost, as an action, you can attempt to identify a valid route to take for a specific intended destination on the same plane of existence as you. Make a spellcasting ability check contested by a DC equal to 10 + the other spell's level (or DC 15 if caused by another magical effect). On a success, the magical effects obfuscating your travel are suppressed for the duration of the spell, during which time the shortest and most direct route to your destination (but not necessarily the safest route) is drawn out as a spectral golden wire on the ground. On a failed check, the spell ends immediately.
