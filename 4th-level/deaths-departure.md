# Death's Departure

_4th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Bard

You perform a melody that repels the walking dead from your immediate vicinity. When an undead creature enters the spell's area of effect for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, they must make a Wisdom Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature is Frightened of you for the duration of the spell, or until they leave the spell's area of effect. Creatures that are normally immune to being Frightened have advantage on this Saving Throw but are otherwise not immune to the Frightened condition caused by this spell. Creatures that are immune to being Turned are not affected by this spell.

On each of your turns, you must use a Magic Action to continue playing the song. The spell ends if you don't take this Magic Action by the end of your turn.
