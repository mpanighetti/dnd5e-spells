# Death's Departure

_4th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You perform a melody that repels the walking dead from your immediate vicinity. When an undead creature enters the spell's area of effect for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is Frightened of you for the duration of the spell (even if it is normally immune to the Frightened condition), or until it leaves the spell's area of effect. Creatures that are normally immune to the Frightened condition have advantage on this save.

On each of your turns, you must use your action to continue playing the song. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else.
