You attempt to diminish a creature you can see within range that can hear you. The target makes a Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, until the spell ends, the target's size is reduced to one-fourth of normal in all dimensions, their weight is reduced to one-sixty-fourth of normal, and their size decreases by two categories (e.g. from Large to Small, minimum Tiny). On a successful save, the spell ends.

Everything the creature is wearing and carrying changes size with them. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

While reduced in this manner, the target's speed is halved; they have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength Saving Throws; they lose any resistance or immunity they have to nonmagical damage; and all of their attacks using either natural weapons or any reduced weapons deal 3d6 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

The spell ends if you are unable to see the target.
