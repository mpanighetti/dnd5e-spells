_Level 5 Illusion/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to manipulate the apparent flow of time for a creature you target in range that can hear you. The target must make an Intelligence Saving Throw, and if you are fighting the target, they have advantage on the Saving Throw. On a failed save, until the spell ends, the target believes that time has passed such that it is either just after sunrise or just after sunset (whichever is the sooner of the two events).

While under the effects of this spell, the creature's senses are modified to convince them of the false time of day. The target's vision makes it appear as if environments are lit by sunlight for a false daytime, or darkened by night for a false nighttime. Any other time-sensitive visuals and sounds (such as a clock's face or a rooster's morning crow) are overlaid with appropriate illusory replacements. The creature is able to see within their illusory environment based on their existing senses as if the illusions are real; for example, a creature with sunlight sensitivity suffers disadvantage on checks that rely on sight while under false daylight conditions of this spell, and a creature with darkvision similarly would be able to see in false nighttime conditions as if it were actually dark. Creatures without darkvision are granted the feature temporarily to allow them to see in dark spaces as if they were lit by illusory daylight.

False memories are implanted in the creature's mind, such that they believe time and events have passed normally. Modified senses and memories don't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, but the creature will make normal efforts to proceed with activities that would make sense for the given time of day. Such activities might include leaving home to work a farm, closing a business for the night, departing for a formal occasion, preparing for bed, or any other time-specific activity.

After the spell ends, the creature becomes aware that their senses and memories were altered by magic.
