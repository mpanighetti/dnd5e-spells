# Song of Healing

_5th-level evocation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel healing energies through soothing music. All creatures that remain within 30 feet of you for the entire casting time, except for undead or constructs, regain 5d10 hit points and are cured of blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting them.

The healing energy attempts to soothe the restless undead and allow them to move on from this world. Each undead creature within the spell's area of effect when it is finished casting must make a Wisdom saving throw (it can choose to fail this save). On a failed save, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, its spirit moves on to the afterlife, and its remains are destroyed in a burst of radiant fire. Creatures that are immune to being turned are not affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, the spell also ends all curses affecting creatures healed by this spell. If any of those creatures are attuned to a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
