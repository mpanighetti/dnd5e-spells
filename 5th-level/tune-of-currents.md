# Tune of Currents

_5th-level Abjuration/Rhythmancy_ (Bard)

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (an instrument worth at least 1 gp; an item that tells time worth 200 gp which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to restore the normal flow of time for a creature within range. This spell can potentially remove the following temporal effects from the target:

- Any spell or magical effect on the target that caused them to grow older or younger
- Any spell or magical effect that caused the target to be removed from their original time period
- _Haste_, _slow_, and any chronurgy[^⏳] spell

Any such spell with a spell level equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used to cast _Tune of Currents_, any such spell for which you were originally the caster, and any such magical effect not caused by a spell is dispelled, ending its effects immediately. A creature magically displaced from their original time period is immediately returned to their era, and all magical aging is removed.

For each spell of a level higher than the spell slot you used, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell's effect on the target ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th-level, you can change the casting time to 1 reaction to a creature you can see within range casting _time stop_.
