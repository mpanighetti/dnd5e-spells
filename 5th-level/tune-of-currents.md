# Tune of Currents

_5th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; an item that tells time worth 200 gp which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Bard

You attempt to restore the normal flow of time for a creature within range. This spell can potentially remove the following temporal effects from the target:

- Any spell or magical effect on the target that caused them to grow older or younger
- Any spell or magical effect that caused the target to be removed from their original time period
- The _haste_, _slow_, and _time stop_ spells

Any such spell with a spell level equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used to cast Tune of Currents, any such spell for which you were originally the caster, and any such magical effect not caused by a spell, is dispelled, ending its effects immediately. A creature magically displaced from their original time period is immediately returned to their era, and all magical aging is removed.

For each spell of a level higher than the level of the spell slot you used with a temporal effect on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals twice the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell's effect on the target ends.
