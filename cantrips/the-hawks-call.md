# The Hawkâ€™s Call

_Evocation/rhythmancy cantrip_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of hawk grass; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You play a series of sharp tones evoking the piercing cry of a bird of prey, summoning a spectral bird to slash its talons at a creature of your choice that you can see within range. The bird can take whatever form you choose, then makes a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the bird deals 1d4 piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on Perception checks and Dexterity saving throws it makes before the end of its next turn as the bird flies in its face to distract it. On a miss, or at the start of your next turn, the bird disappears, ending the spell.

The spell creates more than one bird when you reach higher levels: two birds at 5th level, three birds at 11th level, and four birds at 17th level. You can direct the birds at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each bird. The spell ends at the start of your next turn or if all the birds disappear.
